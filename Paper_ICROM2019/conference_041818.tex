\begin{abstract}
One of the big concern in skin cancer, is to detect the cancer with the high accuracy and so fast. In recent decade deep learning methods have led to a great breakthrough in wide range of cancer detection. 
In this paper, the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network(WGAN) represents to generate synthetic medical images of skin cancer. The artificial database which is obtained based on the WGAN is added to the main database and it is used for improving the performance of Convolutional Neural Network which is designed for classification of the skin cancer based on the medical images. The database which is used for this paper has just 80 images from
the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). According to the results of implementing the designed CNN model on the test database which has 200 members, 87\% of the skin cancer images are detected correctly. \\

\section{Introduction}

Cancer can be regarded as one of the main reasons of human mortality. The fast and high accurate diagnoses about cancers can reduce the risk of death among the patients~\cite{3}. According to the proposed demand, using the artificial intelligence method based on computer aid can consider as a perfect way~\cite{4}. 
In recent two decades, the significant progress in machine learning(ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms and the computers' processing power have been caused a significant grows in using the proposed algorithms in different fields like medical engineering~\cite{5,6,7}. One of the main applications of ML and DL algorithms in field of medical engineering is cancer detection~\cite{8,9,10}.  According to the structure of ML and DL algorithms, having a huge database is necessary to achieve good results. Using data augmentation can solve the lack of database for medical images. Usually the data augmentation methods just consists of scale, rotation, transformation or flip, but for complex modification like pixel transformation, the GAN or WGAN algorithms are more common.
Some of algorithms which have been used for the cancer detection can be regarded as, logistic regression, decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM)~\cite{12, 13}. By using the machine learning algorithms cancer diagnose, the cancer detection speed and quality have been increased and consequently the cancer detection's expenses may reduce, significantly.\\
The main contributions of this paper consist in, producing artificial skin cancer medical images to improve the CNN network by using WGAN. Moreover, design a CNN algorithm to use for benign and malignant skin cancer classification. Finally, assess the performance of the the designed CNN in classification of the benign and malignant skin cancer.\\
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,the characteristics of the data which are used for the designed WGAN for this paper are described. Then, in section 3, the process of designing GAN and WGAN algorithms and the difference of them are explained. In Section 4, the structure of CNN algorithm which is designed to use for classification of the skin cancer based on the medical images is represented. In Section 5, a deep discussion about the results of implementing the CNN algorithm on the test database is completely explained. Finally, the paper concludes with some hints and remaining as ongoing works.

\subsection{Dataset}
The preliminary database which is used for this project has just 80 members. The members of this dataset are the skin cancer images which are collected from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) and they are labelled as skin cancer. 
\subsection{Generating Synthetic Skin Cancer Medical Images}
In the first trace, the Generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithm is implemented on the preliminary databased in order to create the new data, to increase the number of database's members to increasing the accuracy of CNN model.The International Skin Imaging Collaboration database has some limitation for its users to download the data from it.


\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\theta_{d}}\frac{1}{m}\sum_{n=1}^{m}[\log D(x^{i})+\log(1-D(G(z^{i})))]
\label{dgan}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\theta_{g}}\frac{1}{m}\sum_{n=1}^{m} -\log(D(G(z^{i})))
\label{ggan}
\end{equation}



\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\omega}\frac{1}{m}\sum_{n=1}^{m}[f(x^{i})-f(G(z^{i}))]
\label{cwgan}
\end{equation}




\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\omega}\frac{1}{m}\sum_{n=1}^{m} -f(G(z^{i}))
\label{gwgan}
\end{equation}

Equations~\ref{dgan} and \ref{ggan} represent the discriminator and generator functions, respectively, which are used for the GAN algorithm.

Based on the proposed limitation in the first step just 80 images are downloaded. Moreover, the downloaded images are divided in two parts as 55 and 25 for training and test part. The first part,training, is considered to use for generating artificial images from it. Figure~\ref{5} illustrates some of the 55 images, which are used as a database to use in GAN algorithm. In the following the progress of generating artificial images based on GAN method are represented, Figs.~\ref{1} and \ref{2}. According to the Figs.~\ref{1} and \ref{2}, nine artificial images are generated based on 2000 epochs. Figure 3
depicts the 2000th epoch. Based on Fig.~\ref{3}, the performance of the designed GAN algorithim in terms of generating the new medical images is acceptable.

Then, in order to achieve better result the Wasserstein GAN(WGAN) algorithm is implemented on the data. The main difference between the GAN and WGAN can be regarded as, in the WGAN a new cost function using Wasserstein distance that has a smoother gradient everywhere is used, moreover, WGAN learns without paying attention to the generator act.

Figures~\ref{gann} and \ref{wgann} illustrate the stucture of GAN and WGAN algorithms.
the variables which are used in Eqs.~\ref{dgan},~\ref{ggan},~\ref{cwgan}	and \ref{gwgan} are defined as,$z$ is the noise which can consider as a normal or uniform distributions, $G$ , is the generator and it used to create an image based on $x=G(z)$. Moreover, $m$ is the number of noise and examples which are achieved from data generations, $D(x)$, is the function to calculate the probability that $x$ came from the data rather than gener<ator distribution.Furthermore,$\nabla$ is the stochastic gradient decent which is used to training the GAN based on $\theta_{d}$ and $\theta_{g}$ parameters.
Figure~\ref{itere} depicts the obtained images after $1000$ iterations.As it is obvious in the Fig.~\ref{itere}, after each $200$ iterations the quality of the images have been improved.

\subsection{Results}


\section{Model Training}


\subsection{Convlutional Neural Network}
In order to implement the convolutional neural network on the dataset, the
Keras libraries are used. The main steps to set the CNN algorithm on the
proposed dataset can be regarded as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In order to initialize the neural network, the Sequential library is used.
\item In order to make the CNN for the images the Convolution2D is used.
\item The pooling layers are added by using of MaxPooling2D (Reduce the size
of the feature map).
\item The Flatten function is set to convert the pooled feature map to a single
column that is passed to the fully connected layer (All the pooled feature
maps are taken and put into a single vector).
\item The Dense function is used to added fully connected layer to the neural network (Using the input vector for the neural network).
Listing 1 illustrates the process of setting the parameters and functions to design the CNN algorithm.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Results}

\section{Discussion}

\section{Conclusion}
In this report the process of implementing the WGAN algorithm is represented and the main reasons that prove the superiority of the WGAN compare to the GAN algorithm are represented. Moreover, some of the results which are obtained based on the implementation of WGAN are illustrated. Furthermore, the process of designing and implementing the convlotional neural network on the generated databse is described. Based on the results which are obtained from the CNN algorithm implementation, after 300 epochs the accuracy of the training model is 63 percentages which can considered as a so good results by considering the number of the under study database and the number of epochs. Now, the process of collecting data, generalizing new data, making model and
testing the model is finished and the next step is writing a paper by combining the technical reports which are prepared in three versions.
